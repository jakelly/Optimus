Requirements: 

Write a Console Application in C#: 

- Take as input the path of a file containing one integer per line 
- For each Integer in the file, output to the console a comma-delimited list of the integer's prime factors 
- The list of integers on each line of the output should multiply to produce the input integer 
- Please consider user input, error handling etc. in your completed code 

Bonus: include unit tests for the code ( nunit is preferred)
Once complete, email the *.cp file(s) along with an input file we should use as input to your program.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Plan of attack:
	- Generate file of integers
		- Variables:
			- How many numbers do we generate
			- What is the upper limit
			- Overwrite previously generated file?
	- Create  
	- Determine effective algorithm for prime factors
		- f % n = m	(where factor modulus number = 0)
		- [(f + 1) | next highest prime] and repeat until modulus = 0
		- record each number where modulus = 0 (they are prime numbers and will be use to speed up the process)
