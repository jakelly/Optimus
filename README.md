# Optimus
A Console Application to calculate Prime Factors

What are the Prime Factors of 360?  
``` 
2 * 2 * 2 * 3 * 3 * 5 = 2^3 * 3^2 * 5 = 360
```

This program asks a minimal set of questions from the user to generate a file with a list of random numbers.  Those numbers are then fed into an algorithm that produces the prime factors of each random number.
